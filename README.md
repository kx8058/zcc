Hello! Here is a bit about what I did for the Coding Challenge:
	
* I chose to use the CLI rather than browser. 

* I used Python.

* Usage instructions: 

	- Download, unzip folder and run the following commands: 

		- To run the main file, enter 'python3 src/main.py'
	
		- To run the tests, enter 'python3 tests/test.py' (Tests are not implemented as of now.)


Next Steps:

* Fix syntax error in src/main.py

* Improve format of data retrieved

* Implement the feature where tickets are shown in a list of 25 tickets per page if there are more than 25 tickets shown

* Implement tests: 
	
	- Show message if there is an inability to connect to API or the user has entered an invalid response 
	
	- Show message if there is a program error


Side Note: All of this will be zipped and emailed just in case. 


Thank you for this challenge opportunity and taking the time to look over my efforts! Please let me know if there are any questions. I hope you have a great day!
