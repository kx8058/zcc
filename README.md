Hello! Here is a bit about what I did for the Coding Challenge:
	
* I chose to use the CLI rather than browser. 

* I used Python.

* Usage instruction: run 'python3 main.py'


Next Steps:

* Improve format of data retrieved

* Implement tests: 
	
	- Show message if there is an inability to connect to API or the user has entered an in valid response 
	
	- Show message if there a program error


Thank you for this opportunity and taking the time to look over my efforts! Please let me know if there are any questions. I hope you have a great day!
