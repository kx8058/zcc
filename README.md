Coding Challenge

Hello! Here is a bit about what I did for the coding challenge:
	* I chose to use the CLI rather than browser. 
	* I used Python.
	* Usage instruction: run 'python3 main.py'

Next Steps: (TBA)
	* Improve format of data retrieved
	* Implement tests: 
		- Show message if there is an inability to connect to API or the user has entered an in valid response 
		- Show message if there a program error


Thank you for this opportunity and taking the time to look over my efforts! Please let me know if there are any questions. I hope you have a great day!
